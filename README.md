##Project: Design an interactive quiz with javascript

##Steps: 

- Create start page with "start" button to kick off timer and start first quiz question

- Step one set up timeer 

- Create quiz qustions and answer options with buttons. Utilize DOM method to generate each question prompt

- Log user's answer for each question and provide true or false comment

- If false - reduce timer by 10 secs

- When timer runs out or all questions are answered, prompt to page for user initial and score for submission. (no actual submission set up for this button)

- All the variables and HTML assignments are using DOM method. I started this project before learning about Jquery. Will update the code using Jquery in next revision.
